## Editor

You basically need 2 things to start coding CSS:

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other editor)
2. Nah, nothing else.

just download VS Code and you're good to go. The editor is not important, you can use any other editor. But VS Code has some handful extensions that can make your life easier.
