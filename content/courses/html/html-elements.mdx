## What are HTML Elements?

Imagine building a house. You need bricks, windows, doors, and a roof to create a sturdy structure. Similarly, web pages are built using **HTML elements**. These are the fundamental building blocks that provide structure and meaning to the content displayed in a web browser.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Element

Every HTML element consists of two parts:

1. **The Starting Tag:** 
   - Begins with a less than symbol (`<`) followed by the element name. 
   - For example: `<p>` for a paragraph, `<h1>` for a level 1 heading.

2. **The Ending Tag:** 
   - Begins with a less than symbol (`<`) followed by a forward slash (`/`) and then the element name. 
   - For example: `</p>`, `</h1>`.

**Content:** 
- The content of the element goes between the starting and ending tags.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

## Common HTML Elements

Here are some of the most commonly used HTML elements:

- **`<html>`:** The root element of the page. 
- **`<head>`:** Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title.
- **`<title>`:** Defines the title that appears in the browser tab.
- **`<body>`:** Contains the visible content of the HTML document.
- **`<h1>` to `<h6>`:** Defines headings with different levels of importance.
- **`<p>`:** Defines a paragraph of text.
- **`<br>`:** Inserts a line break.
- **`<img>`:** Inserts an image.
- **`<a>`:** Creates a hyperlink.
- **`<ul>`:** Creates an unordered list.
- **`<ol>`:** Creates an ordered list.
- **`<li>`:** Defines a list item within a list.

## Attributes

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are written within the starting tag, in the form of `name="value"`.

**Example:**

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image of a cat"> 
```

- `src`: Specifies the URL of the image.
- `alt`: Provides alternative text for screen readers and if the image fails to load.
