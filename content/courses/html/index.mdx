## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's the foundational language for creating web pages. Think of it as the blueprint for a house â€“ it defines the structure and content, but doesn't actually build the house itself.

## Key Concepts

- **Elements:** These are the building blocks of an HTML document. They are represented by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`).
- **Tags:**
  - **Opening Tag:** Marks the beginning of an element (e.g., `<p>`).
  - **Closing Tag:** Marks the end of an element (e.g., `</p>`).
  - **Self-Closing Tags:** Some elements don't have content and only have an opening tag (e.g., `<br>`, `<hr>`).
- **Attributes:** These provide additional information about an element. They are written within the opening tag (e.g., `<a href="https://www.example.com">Link to Example</a>`).

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** Tells the browser it's an HTML5 document.
- **`<html>`:** The root element of the page.
- **`<head>`:** Contains meta-information about the page, such as the title.
- **`<title>`:** Defines the title that appears in the browser tab.
- **`<body>`:** Contains the visible content of the page.

## Common HTML Elements

- **Headings:** `<h1>` (largest), `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- **Paragraphs:** `<p>`
- **Images:** `<img>` (requires `src` attribute for the image source)
- **Links:** `<a>` (requires `href` attribute for the link destination)
- **Lists:**
  - Ordered lists: `<ol>` with `<li>` for each item
  - Unordered lists: `<ul>` with `<li>` for each item
- **Divisions:** `<div>` (used for grouping and styling content)
- **Spans:** `<span>` (used for inline styling and grouping)

## Example: Creating a Simple Web Page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Simple Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my Simple Page</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
  </body>
</html>
```
