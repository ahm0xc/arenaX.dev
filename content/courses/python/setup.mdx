In this guide, you'll learn how to set up **Python 3** and **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) for development. We'll cover:

- **Installing** Python
- **Configuring** VS Code with the Python extension
- Getting your development **environment** ready

With this setup, you'll be able to write, run, and debug Python code efficiently while taking advantage of VS Code's powerful features for Python development.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3](#python-installation)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

## Python installation

Along with the Python extension, you need to install a Python interpreter. Which interpreter you use is dependent on your specific needs, but some guidance is provided below.

### Windows

Install Python from [Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Use the Download Python button that appears first on the page to download the latest version.

<Callout type="info">
If you don't have admin access, an additional option for installing Python on Windows is to use the Microsoft Store. The Microsoft Store provides installs of [supported Python versions](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/search?publisher=Python%20Software%20Foundation).
</Callout>

### MacOS

The system install of Python on macOS is not supported. Instead, a package management system like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is recommended. To install Python using Homebrew on macOS use the following command at the Terminal prompt:

```bash title="Terminal"
brew install python3
```

<Callout type="info">
On macOS, make sure the location of your VS Code installation is included in your PATH environment variable. See [these setup instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) for more information.
</Callout>

### Linux

The built-in Python 3 installation on Linux works well, but to install other Python packages you must install `pip` with [get-pip.py](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#get-pip-py).

### Other Options

- **Data Science**: If your primary purpose for using Python is Data Science, then you might consider a download from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda provides not just a Python interpreter, but many useful libraries and tools for data science.
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux**: If you are working on Windows and want a Linux environment for working with Python, the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about) (WSL) is an option for you. If you choose this option, you'll also want to install the [WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl). For more information about using WSL with VS Code, see [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) or try the [Working in WSL tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial), which will walk you through setting up WSL, installing Python, and creating a Hello World application running in WSL.


<Callout type="info">
To verify that you've installed Python successfully on your machine, run one of the following commands (depending on your operating system):

**Linux/macOS**: open a Terminal Window and type the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
python3 --version
```

**Windows**: open a command prompt and run the following command:

```bash title="Command Prompt"
py -3 --version
```

If the installation was successful, the output window should show the version of Python that you installed. Alternatively, you can use the `py -0` command in the `VS Code integrated terminal` to view the versions of python installed on your machine. The default interpreter is identified by an asterisk (*).
</Callout>

## Quick guide

If you only wanted to install Python and not want to go through an simple example, you can skip everything bellow. But try to follow along to get familiar with the VS Code & Python environment.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Start VS Code in a workspace folder

Start VS Code in a folder, that folder becomes your "workspace".

Using a command prompt or terminal, create an empty folder called `"hello"`, navigate into it, and open VS Code (`code`) in that folder (`.`) by entering the following commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir hello
cd hello
code .
```

<Callout type="info">
If you're using an Anaconda distribution, be sure to use an Anaconda command prompt.
</Callout>

Alternately, you can create a folder through the operating system UI, then use VS Code's `File > Open Folder` to open the project folder.
</Step>
<Step>
### Create a virtual environment

A best practice among Python developers is to use a project-specific `virtual environment`. Once you activate that environment, any packages you then install are isolated from other environments, including the global interpreter environment, reducing many complications that can arise from conflicting package versions. You can create non-global environments in VS Code using Venv or Anaconda with `Python: Create Environment`.

Open the `Command Palette` (`â‡§âŒ˜P`), start typing the **"Python: Create Environment"** command to search, and then select the command.

The command presents a list of environment types, `Venv` or `Conda`. For this example, select `Venv`.

![Create Environment](/assets/python/setup/command-prompt-venv.png)

The command then presents a list of interpreters that can be used for your project. Select the `interpreter` you installed at the beginning of the tutorial.

![Select Interpreter](/assets/python/setup/command-prompt-interpreter-prompt.png)

After selecting the interpreter, a notification will show the progress of the environment creation and the environment folder (`/.venv`) will appear in your workspace.

Ensure your new environment is selected by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette.

![Select Interpreter](/assets/python/setup/command-prompt-select-interpreter.png)

<Callout type="info">
For additional information about virtual environments, or if you run into an error in the environment creation process, see [Environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments).
</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
### Create a Python source code file

From the File Explorer toolbar, select the New File button on the `hello` folder:

![New File](/assets/python/setup/xvb.png)

By using the `.py` file extension, you tell VS Code to interpret this file as a Python program, so that it evaluates the contents with the Python extension and the selected interpreter.

<Callout type="info">
The File Explorer toolbar also allows you to create folders within your workspace to better organize your code. You can use the New folder button to quickly create a folder.
</Callout>

Now that you have a code file in your Workspace, enter the following source code in `hello.py`:

```python
msg = "Roll a dice!"
print(msg)
```

When you start typing print, notice how [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) presents auto-completion options.

![IntelliSense](/assets/python/setup/mnj.png)

IntelliSense and auto-completions work for standard Python modules as well as other packages you've installed into the environment of the selected Python interpreter. It also provides completions for methods available on object types. For example, because the `msg` variable contains a string, IntelliSense provides string methods when you type `msg.`.

Finally, save the file (`âŒ˜S`). At this point, you're ready to run your first Python file in VS Code.
</Step>
<Step>
### Run the Python file

Click the Run Python File play button in the top-right side of the editor.

![Run Python File](/assets/python/setup/iuy.png)

The button opens a terminal panel in which your Python interpreter is automatically activated, then runs `python3 hello.py` (macOS/Linux) or `python hello.py` (Windows):

![Run](/assets/python/setup/lko.png)

There are three other ways you can run Python code within VS Code:

1. Right-click anywhere in the editor window and select Run `Python > Run Python File in Terminal` (which saves the file automatically):

![Run Python File in Terminal](/assets/python/setup/run-python-file-in-terminal.png)

2. Select one or more lines, then press `Shift+Enter` or `right-click` and select `Run Python > Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal`. Alternatively, you can activate Smart Send using `Shift+Enter` without a selection and the Python extension will send the smallest runnable block of code near where your **cursor is placed to the terminal**. This command is convenient for testing just a part of a file.

<Callout type="info">
If you prefer to send code at the particular line your cursor is placed, you can turn off Smart Send by setting `python.REPL.enableREPLSmartSend: "false"` in your User settings.
</Callout>

3. From the `Command Palette` (`â‡§âŒ˜P`), select the `Python: Start Terminal REPL` command to open a REPL terminal (notated by **>>>**) for the currently selected Python interpreter. In the REPL, you can then enter and run lines of code one at a time.

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you just ran your first Python code in Visual Studio Code!
</Step>

<Step>
### Install and use packages

Let's build upon an simple example by using packages.

In Python, packages are how you obtain any number of useful code libraries, typically from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), that provide additional functionality to your program. For this example, you use the `numpy` package to generate a random number.

Return to the **Explorer** view (the top-most icon on the left side, which shows files), open `hello.py`, and paste in the following source code:

```python
import numpy as np

msg = "Roll a dice!"
print(msg)

print(np.random.randint(1,9))
```

<Callout type="info">
If you enter the above code by hand, you may find that auto-completions change the names after the `as` keywords when you press `Enter` at the end of a line. To avoid this, type a space, then `Enter`.
</Callout>

Next, run the file in the debugger using the "Python: Current file" configuration as described in the last section.

You should see the message, `"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'"`. This message indicates that the required package isn't available in your interpreter. If you're using an Anaconda distribution or have previously installed the `numpy` package you may not see this message.

To install the `numpy` package, stop the debugger and use the Command Palette to run `Terminal: Create New Terminal` (`âŒƒâ‡§``). This command opens a command prompt for your selected interpreter.

To install the required packages in your virtual environment, enter the following commands as appropriate for your operating system:

#### Installing dependencies
```bash title="Terminal"
# Don't use with Anaconda distributions because they include matplotlib already.

# macOS
python3 -m pip install numpy

# Windows (may require elevation)
py -m pip install numpy

# Linux (Debian)
apt-get install python3-tk
python3 -m pip install numpy
```

Now, run the file again.

#### Managing dependencies across environments

When working on Python projects, it&apos;s essential to manage your dependencies effectively. One useful tip is to use the `pip freeze > requirements.txt` command. This command helps you create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the packages installed in your virtual environment. This file can then be used to recreate the same environment elsewhere.

Follow these steps to create a requirements.txt file:

<Steps>
<Step>
##### Activate your virtual environment, if you havenâ€™t already.
```bash title="Terminal"
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```
```bash title="Terminal"
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```
</Step>
<Step>
##### Generate the requirements.txt file.
```bash title="Terminal"
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
</Step>
</Steps>

You can now use the newly generated `requirements.txt` file to install dependencies in another environment. Furthermore, you can continue to add dependencies to it as your project may grow in complexity.

```bash title="Terminal"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
By following these steps, you ensure that your project dependencies are consistent across different environments, making it easier to collaborate with others and deploy your project.
</Step>
</Steps>

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you've just installed and used packages in your Python environment!
